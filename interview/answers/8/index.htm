Considering today's media environment, it is impossible to achieve a certain level of
success in any field without having detractors.  What do you have to say about
your critics?</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/a.gif" WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="45" BORDER="0" HSPACE=6 ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Every day I get letters from people thanking me for
helping them to become successful, whether because of their personal growth or because of
economic rewards.  I understand that a few of my former students have even become
millionaires.
<IMG SRC="../images/buddha5.jpg" ALT="Buddha" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="138" BORDER="0" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>
More importantly, the vast majority of the students I have taught have become
self-sufficient and confident individuals who enjoy their lives. Nevertheless, it
is inevitable that, in the process of teaching an Asian religion in a Western country,
many of the teachings will seem strange or unusual -- in the same way that Christianity
and Judaism may seem strange and unusual to people from the Far East.  Although it is
regrettable, it is understandable that over the years, my teaching -- of what is
perceived to be a complex and foreign-sounding religious philosophy -- has become the
target for people's prejudice and religious intolerance.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/himalaya.jpg" ALT="Himalayas" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="135" BORDER="0" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>Certainly, I am aware that there have been a number of articles written about me and television shows in which I have been featured and referred to as a "cult leader."  These stories -- and that is exactly what they are, <I>stories</I> -- have been concocted and repeated over and over again by a very small but vocal handful of persons who, for a variety of misguided reasons, have fed the media's insatiable appetite for "cult" stories.  
The source of their motivation ranges from what you might expect -- from the seeking
of money and publicity, to those who genuinely suffer from chronic personal problems
and have fixated on me as the cause of their frustrations and failures.
<P>
I don't think there is anyone in public life today who can escape the inevitable
onslaught of the media.  It seeks to pry into and often grossly distort aspects of
one's personal and professional life.  I guess it just comes with the territory.
When you combine a media
<IMG WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="256" SRC="../images/books.jpg" ALT="Snowboarding to Nirvana and Surfing the Himalayas" BORDER="0" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>--
bent on exploiting tabloid-type stories to boost ratings and circulation by innuendo
and titillation -- with unhappy or opportunistic individuals who have nothing going for
them in their own lives, you get a bitter brew.
<P>
All I can say is that these cult stories are totally untrue, are without any
foundation, and trade on a deep bias against Westerners who dare to embrace an
Eastern belief-system.  Sometimes, I find it ironic to read stories about myself
which have never occurred and are simply so absurd that they are comical.  At other
times, it is very painful to be so misinterpreted and vilified. And yet, maintaining
balance in the face of adversity and overcoming hatred, intolerance and prejudice is
precisely what my philosophy is all about -- and is what I have striven to teach
throughout my adult life.
<P>
Perhaps my own struggle against the negativity created by these so-called critics,
has enabled me to develop a more resilient, peaceful, inner strength which I, in
turn, have attempted to communicate to others.  
It is one thing to teach a dynamic Oriental philosophy and religious code; it is
quite another to put such a discipline to the test by
<IMG SRC="../images/buddha4.gif" ALT="Buddha" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="128" BORDER="0" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>
successfully living it in the face of ridicule.  Obviously, following my convictions
has come at a personal price, but they are important enough that I have been willing
to endure the abuse.
<P>
If a person is really interested in what I have to say and what I teach, rather
than hearing it second- or third-hand, I suggest that they read <I>Surfing the
Himalayas</I> or <I>Snowboarding to Nirvana</I> and make their own decision about
the merits of my philosophy and moral code.  
Much of what I have taught concerning meditation and Eastern philosophy is contained
in these two books -- with, I hope, more to come.  In the near future, I am looking
forward to graduating from the world of fiction (albeit fiction based upon my personal
experiences) and write a comprehensive autobiography.  Ultimately that will be the work
which will embody the whole of what I have experienced and accomplished.</FONT>
